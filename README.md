This project focuses on a Python-based regional sales analysis using five years of historical data to uncover trends across products, channels, and U.S. regions. The data was pre-processed by merging multiple tables (sales, customers, products, budgets, and geography), handling column standardization, and engineering features like profit and profit margin. Visualizations and aggregations were used to explore monthly sales cycles, top-selling SKUs, regional revenue distribution, and channel performance.

Key findings include strong seasonality in revenue, with peaks in Mayâ€“June and dips in January, and a concentration of sales in products 25 and 26. Wholesale emerged as the dominant channel by volume, while Export offered higher margins. California and the West region outperformed others, while the Northeast lagged. Based on these insights, the project recommends seasonal promotions, SKU and channel optimization, and regional investments to boost performance. All analysis was performed using Python with libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
